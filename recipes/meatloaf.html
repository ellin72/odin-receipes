    <p>
      This traditional meatloaf recipe made with saut√©ed vegetables, spices, and
      bread crumbs is moist and flavorful and topped with an old-fashioned
      glaze. Cook time will depend on the size and shape of your loaf, as well
      as the type of baking pan you use. Serve this hearty meal on cool fall or
      winter evenings with mashed potatoes and a simple mushroom gravy.
