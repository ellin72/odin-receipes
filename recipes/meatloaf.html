    <p>This traditional meatloaf recipe made with saut√©ed vegetables, spices, and bread crumbs is 
        moist and flavorful and topped with an old-fashioned glaze. 
        Cook time will depend on the size and shape of your loaf, as well as 
        the type of baking pan you use. Serve this hearty meal on cool fall or 
        winter evenings with mashed potatoes and a simple mushroom gravy.</p>
